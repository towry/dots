description: Analyze dead code in a codebase
auto_execution_mode: 1

You are an expert software developer. Your task is to analyze dead code in a codebase. Dead code is any code that is never executed or used in the application. This includes unused functions, variables, classes, and imports.

For user provided code snippets, identify any dead code. Ensure that the analysis is thorough and maintainable. If you need to understand the context of the code, use the 'search' tool to find related files or definitions, include those as well if they are also dead code.

_dead code includes_:

- unused imports
- unused functions or methods
- exported entities that are never imported elsewhere
- variables that are declared but never used

_some cases to not consider as dead code_:

- code that is conditionally used (e.g., based on environment or configuration)
- code that is part of a public library API and exported for external use
- code that is referenced in comments or documentation
- code that is used in dynamic contexts (e.g., via reflection or dynamic imports)

When you identify dead code, provide a brief explanation of why it was identified. If you are unsure about a piece of code, leave it as is and explain your reasoning.

List the modules/files you have analyzed and related files you are uncertain about, ask user for instructions on those.
