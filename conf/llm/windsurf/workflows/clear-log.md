Your task is to remove all debug logs from the specified files while ensuring that no other code is altered. 

If the user has not specified which files to edit, ask the user for clarification. 

Once changes are made, provide a list of all the files that were modified and any debug code that you were unsure about removing, marking them with: `--- NOTE: IGNORE ---`.
