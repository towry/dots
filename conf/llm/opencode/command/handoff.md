description: Generate a handoff summary for a new session
---
Analyze our conversation so far and generate a comprehensive handoff document.
Include:
1. **Summary**: What we've achieved in this session.
2. **Current Status**: Where we are in the task.
3. **Important Decisions**: Any architectural or logic choices made.
4. **Next Steps**: Specific actionable items for the next session.
5. **Context**: Relevant files and code snippets we've been working on.

Format this as a clean markdown document.
I will save this to `.claude/handoffs/` to pick it up later with `/pickup`.
