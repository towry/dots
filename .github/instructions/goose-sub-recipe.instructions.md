description: Sub-Recipes For Specialized Tasks
---


Sub-recipes are recipes that are used by another recipe to perform specific tasks. They enable:
- **Multi-step workflows** - Break complex tasks into distinct phases with specialized expertise
- **Reusable components** - Create common tasks that can be used in various workflows

## How Sub-Recipes Work

The "main recipe" registers its sub-recipes in the `sub_recipes` field, which contains the following fields:

- `name`: Unique identifier for the sub-recipe, used to generate the tool name
- `path`: File path to the sub-recipe file (relative or absolute)
- `values`: (Optional) Pre-configured parameter values that are always passed to the sub-recipe

When the main recipe is run, Goose generates a tool for each sub-recipe that:
- Accepts parameters defined by the sub-recipe
- Executes the sub-recipe in a separate session with its own context
- Returns output to the main recipe

Sub-recipe sessions run in isolation - they don't share conversation history, memory, or state with the main recipe or other sub-recipes. Additionally, sub-recipes cannot define their own sub-recipes (no nesting allowed).

### Parameter Handling

Parameters received by sub-recipes can be used in prompts and instructions using `{{ parameter_name }}` syntax. Sub-recipes receive parameters in two ways:

1. **Pre-set values**: Fixed parameter values defined in the `values` field are automatically provided and cannot be overridden at runtime
2. **Context-based parameters**: The AI agent can extract parameter values from the conversation context, including results from previous sub-recipes

Pre-set values take precedence over context-based parameters. If both the conversation context and `values` field provide the same parameter, the `values` version is used..

:::tip
Use the `indent()` filter to maintain valid YAML format when passing multi-line parameter values to sub-recipes, for example: `{{ content | indent(2) }}`. See [Template Support](/docs/guides/recipes/recipe-reference#template-support) for more details.

### Conditional Processing

This Smart Project Analyzer example shows conditional logic that chooses between different sub-recipes based on analysis:

**Usage:**
```bash
goose run --recipe smart-analyzer.yaml --params repository_path=/path/to/project
```

**Main Recipe:**

```yaml
# smart-analyzer.yaml
version: "1.0.0"
title: "Smart Project Analyzer"
description: "Analyze project and choose appropriate processing based on type"
instructions: |
  First examine the repository to determine the project type (web app, CLI tool, library, etc.).
  Based on what you find:
  - If it's a web application, use the web_security_audit sub-recipe
  - If it's a CLI tool or library, use the api_documentation sub-recipe
  Only run one sub-recipe based on your analysis.

parameters:
  - key: repository_path
    input_type: string
    requirement: required
    description: "Path to the repository to analyze"

sub_recipes:
  - name: "web_security_audit"

### Context-Based Parameter Passing

This Travel Planner example shows how sub-recipes can receive parameters from conversation context, including results from previous sub-recipes:

**Usage:**
```bash
goose run --recipe travel-planner.yaml --params target_location="Sydney"
```

**Main Recipe:**

```yaml
# travel-planner.yaml
version: "1.0.0"
title: "Travel Activity Planner"
description: "Get weather data and suggest appropriate activities"
instructions: |
  Plan activities by first getting weather data, then suggesting activities based on conditions.

parameters:
  - key: target_location
    input_type: string
    requirement: required
    description: "City or location for travel planning"

prompt: |
  Run the following sub-recipes:
    - Use weather_data sub-recipe to get current weather for {{ target_location }}
    - Use activity_suggestions sub-recipe to recommend activities based on the weather conditions

sub_recipes:
  - name: weather_data
    path: "./sub-recipes/weather-data.yaml"
    # No values - location parameter comes from prompt context

  - name: activity_suggestions
    path: "./sub-recipes/activity-suggestions.yaml"
    # weather_conditions parameter comes from conversation context

extensions:
  - type: builtin
    name: developer
    timeout: 300
    bundled: true
```

**Sub-Recipes:**

<details>
  <summary>weather_data</summary>
  ```yaml
  # sub-recipes/weather-data.yaml
  version: "1.0.0"
  title: "Weather Data Collector"
  description: "Fetch current weather conditions for a location"
  instructions: |
    You are a weather data specialist. Gather current weather information
    including temperature, conditions, and seasonal context.

  parameters:
    - key: location
      input_type: string
      requirement: required
      description: "City or location to get weather data for"

  extensions:
    - type: builtin
      name: developer
      timeout: 300
      bundled: true

  prompt: |
    Get the current weather conditions for {{ location }}.
    Include temperature, weather conditions (sunny, rainy, etc.),
    and any relevant seasonal information.
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>activity_suggestions</summary>
  ```yaml
  # sub-recipes/activity-suggestions.yaml
  version: "1.0.0"
  title: "Activity Recommender"
  description: "Suggest activities based on weather conditions"
  instructions: |
    You are a travel expert. Recommend appropriate activities and attractions
    based on current weather conditions.

  parameters:
    - key: weather_conditions
      input_type: string
      requirement: required
      description: "Current weather conditions to base recommendations on"

  extensions:
    - type: builtin
      name: developer
      timeout: 300
      bundled: true

  prompt: |
    Based on these weather conditions: {{ weather_conditions }},
    suggest appropriate activities, attractions, and travel tips.
    Include both indoor and outdoor options as relevant.
  ```
</details>

In this example:
- The `weather_data` sub-recipe gets `location: "Sydney"` from the prompt context (extracted from the target_location parameter)
- The `activity_suggestions` sub-recipe gets `weather_conditions` from the conversation context (the AI agent uses the weather results from the first sub-recipe)

## Best Practices
- **Single responsibility**: Each sub-recipe should have one clear purpose
- **Clear parameters**: Use descriptive names and descriptions
- **Pre-set fixed values**: Use `values` for parameters that don't change
- **Test independently**: Verify sub-recipes work alone before combining
