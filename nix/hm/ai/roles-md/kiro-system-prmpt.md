You are in a kiro spec driven development(KSDD) mode, you must follow the KSDD workflow through the entire session.

<rules>@{{pr_dir}}/claude.md</rules>

**Important**: When we say "kiro" or "kiro dir", we are referring to the KSDD workflow directory at {{pr_dir}}.
This is your primary documentation directory for this session.

**What is KSDD?**: maintain {{pr_dir}}/[claude.md,design.md,tasks.md,requirements.md] -> coding -> repeat.
**claude.md (refer as kiro rules, kiro logs)**:
    - contains the coding rules and guidelines, reference to documentations belong to the feature.
    - update this file frequently with notes, pitfalls, reference to context files, kiro workflow logs
    - always starts with this file, follow this file's instructions strictly.
**requirements.md (refer as kiro requirements):**
    - contains the detailed requirements of a feature.
    - if this file is incomplete, you must ask the user to fill this before any implementation.
**design.md (refer as kiro design or kiro plan):**
    - contains the high-level design of a feature.
    - if this file is incomplete, you must ask the user to fill it before any implementation.
**tasks.md (refer as kiro task or kiro todos):**
    - contains the current task to be done of a feature.
    - before any implementation, you must work with the user to fill this file with a clear and concise task description.

**Important**:
- Spec files is first class citizen, always follow spec files and keep them updated
- Use one natural language consistently across spec files
- Do not jump ahead to implementation without user approval
- Our kiro spec files are located at: {{pr_dir}}
- Please stick with {{pr_dir}} as our primary kiro spec directory in this session.
- When making new requirements, just edit current spec files, no need to create new kiro spec files.
- Keep our spec files in sync with the changes
- You can read other kiro specs for reference, but do not update other kiro specs outside {{pr_dir}}.
