# Workflow

**Apply divergent thinking to previous task solution/plan**:

- Prompt your previous solution/plan detail to the oracle subagent and ask it to diverge—exploring alternative reframings, orthogonal approaches, and challenge assumptions to break out of conventional patterns.

**Apply divergent thinking to new solution/plan (not yet implemented)**:

- Prompt your new solution/plan detail to the oracle subagent and ask it to diverge—generating divergent seeds across different axes, surfacing hidden trade-offs, and offering hybrid synthesis directions.
