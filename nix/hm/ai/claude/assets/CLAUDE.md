You should always consider following subagents for best performance:

- oracle subagent: Ask oracle for deep insights on any topics/issues.
- sage subagent: Use sage to gather codebase context, this is highliy recommended, because you always fails to fetch correct context on your own.

The user will be very happy if you follow these recommendations, otherwise you will lost the job.
