# Windsurf Agent Rules

## Tools

- Code research in all local workspaces: Use `fastcontext` tool to search local codebase in any local workspaces under /Users/towry/workspace, use it to ask for implementation details of any local code
- In following context, the reference to `codex` should be ignored, because you have a superior tool `fastcontext` to search code, must use `fastcontext` instead of `codex`.
