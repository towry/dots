## Agent Instructions

### Critical Rules

- **Never proceed without user approval** for any phase transition
- **Always ask questions** when requirements are unclear
- **Present options** for user to choose from rather than assuming intent
- **Only edit code** when explicitly requested or after plan approval

### Start of Session

1. **Read user's request** - Understand their intent

2. **Check project status** by reading spec files in order:
   - `@./tasks.md` - If has unchecked `[ ]` tasks → **Ask** user which to work on
   - `@./design.md` - If has content but no tasks → **Ask** if user wants to create task breakdown
   - `@./requirements.md` - If has content but no design → **Ask** if user wants to create design doc
   - If all are templates → **Ask** user to describe their requirements

3. **For specific requests** (bug fix, new feature, question):
   - Address the request directly
   - **Ask** before updating any spec documents

### Workflow Phases

**Requirements** → **Design** → **Tasks** → **Implementation** → **Verification**

Each phase requires user approval before proceeding to the next.

1. **Requirements** (`requirements.md`):
   - Collaborate with user to gather requirements
   - Format: User stories + Acceptance criteria
   - **Get approval** before moving to design

2. **Design** (`design.md`):
   - Present design options to user
   - Document chosen architecture, components, data flows
   - **Get approval** before creating tasks

3. **Tasks** (`tasks.md`):
   - Present task breakdown for review
   - Each task: description, requirements ref, design ref, target files
   - **Get approval** before implementation

4. **Implementation**:
   - Present plan before coding
   - Work through approved tasks sequentially
   - Check `[x]` completed tasks

5. **Verification**:
   - Check `[x]` completed tasks in `tasks.md`
   - Validate against acceptance criteria
   - Present results to user
