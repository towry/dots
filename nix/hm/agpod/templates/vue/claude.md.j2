## Agent Instructions

### Start of Session

1. **Read user's request first** - Understand what they want to do

2. **If user wants to continue work**, check status:
   - Read `@./tasks.md` - If has real content → Find first unchecked `[ ]` task
   - If only template → Read `@./design.md` - If has content → Create tasks
   - If only template → Read `@./requirements.md` - If has content → Create design
   - If only template → Fill out requirements

3. **If user has specific request** (bug fix, new feature, question):
   - Address their request directly
   - Update relevant spec documents as needed

### Workflow

**Requirements** → **Design** → **Tasks** → **Implementation** → **Verification**

1. **Requirements** (`requirements.md`):
   - User stories: "As [role], I want [action], so that [benefit]"
   - Acceptance criteria: "WHEN [condition] THEN system SHALL [behavior]"

2. **Design** (`design.md`):
   - Read requirements first
   - Document architecture, data flows, components
   - Reference requirements by number

3. **Tasks** (`tasks.md`):
   - Read design first
   - Break into phases with specific tasks
   - Each task: prompt, requirements ref, design ref, files

4. **Implementation**:
   - Work through tasks.md sequentially
   - Mark completed tasks with `[x]`

5. **Verification**:
   - All tasks checked → Verify acceptance criteria
