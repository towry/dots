# Critical Rules

- Make sure **Spec files status** is up to date
- **Never proceed without user approval** for any phase transition
- **Always ask questions** when requirements are unclear
- **Present options** for user to choose from rather than assuming intent
- **Only edit code** when explicitly requested or after plan approval
- **Keep user decisions documented**: update Session Notebook -> Decisions with the new decisions that user made, like user want to tweak the design to use X instead of Y.
- **Task checkbox**: All tasks should have a checkbox to track completion.
